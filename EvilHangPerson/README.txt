If you have played Hang Person before.. Well.. You haven't tried the Evil Hangperson Game yet.

Evil Hangperson is coded in Java with a Swing GUI. It also has an dictionary file of more than 10000 words. 
Every time you guess a letter, it always tries to come up with a word not containing that letter.

A customized data structure (cached map) was created in this project, to minimize the time needed for word filtering (It actually takes a long time to filter through 10000 words). 

It turns out that this game is very hard to debug, because I could never win in normal mode...
When you die though, we do draw a classic hanged person in our Swing GUI.
