This is Plant vs Zombies Game coded in Java!
(Try it, it's actually playable. And we thought it was fun! PopCap owns copyright to all images/music)

This project has a MVC structure: Swing GUI, game algorithms in Java, each type of zombie/plant has a Java class. We also created a seperate thread for the background music player.
