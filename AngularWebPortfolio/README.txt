This is my official, prettiest portfolio, coded mainly using Angularjs and Bootstrap!

! You can check out the actual running site, hosted on RawGit:

Shal herself did all the color design, web layout and coding.
Most data are stored in JSON format.

A few plugins are used:
d3 for Data Visualization
Youtube Embed Code
Hotjar for tracking user interactions and improving user experience.

Unfortunately this page is not optimized for phone screens (I actually don't like the tiny smartphone browser that much). 
However this page will be partially responsive to screen sizes!
