This project implements Image Recognition/Computer Vision/Artificial Intelligence in Java.

We use a pre-parsed database of 60000 hand-written numbers to train the machine. Each pixel of the image is assigned with a weight that correlates with a hand-written number. 
Then the machine is tested using 10000 TEST hand-written numbers.

Both logistic regression (deep learning) and linear regression learning are implemented in this algorithm. Linear regression has a higher correct regonition rate (87%), while logistic regression is 78%.

See src/Output.txt for more details and some sample outputs! All the numbers are intriguingly printed out in the txt file using ASCII characters.
