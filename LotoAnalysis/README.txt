Upon a client's request, I wrote this project to "predict" future Loto winning numbers.
Algorithms were provided by the client. Thus I cannot comment whether they work or not. However the client reported that he had not become a millionaire, even with the help of this app.

This app has a MVC structure: a Swing GUI Interface, algorithms written in Java, and data stored in an external txt file. Then the client will be enabled to perform different kinds of calculations based on recent Loto numbers.
This project was written at the end of my freshman year, so definitely not very sophisticated! I see a lot of things I should improve, and have learnt a lot of new tricks since then! But well..
